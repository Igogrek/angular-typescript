# angular-typescript
Angular typescript starter project

This project is intended to be simple AngularJS + Typescript starter application.

There are plenty of options already available at the moment but most of them either lack features or have quite complex build process.

This project will try to find the middle between build complexity and feature fullness.

### TODO:
- Asset modules
- Gulp4 migration with runSequence depreaction
- Support for source maps with minified code (Broken currently for minified JS)
- Add test configuration and write simple tests
